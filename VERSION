# THE PLANS               #
###########################
- Short-term :
        * Visualization / contribution chart    (High / 2 ~ 4 weeks)
        * Algorithm : Quasi-Monte-Carlo method (upgrade to first-order accuracy)
                                                (High / 2 weeks)
                      Successive-and-Over Relaxation method in ALI (optimize stability of ALI)
                                                (High / 2 weeks)

        * Application of line-fitting           (Medium-to-High)
        * Infrared pumping                      (Medium)
        * consistency of the intialization for molecule with HDF format and data structures
                                                (Medium-Low)
        * 1-D solver could be simplified        (Low)
        
        * (automatic converged mapping)
        * (arbitrary bounday / painter's algorithm -- for user's flexibility)
        * (synthetic cube off-center : crpix may have bug)
        
- Mid-term :
        * "pre-sparx" project -- integrated preprocessor
                To make the gridding efficient and reliable (show the limitation)
                feature : 1. warning of excessive velocity gradient
                          2. output of the error of mass
        
        * Validation : 1. compile benchmark in 2002
                       2. validation over all coordinate systems 
                - 
        * capability of unstructured grid solvers

- Long-term :
        * angular high-order scheme (upgrade to second-order accuracy)
